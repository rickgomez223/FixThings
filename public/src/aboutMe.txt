I have 5+ Years Of Experience, Working As A Mobile Mechanic Around Tucson. Within Those Years I've Worked On All Kinds Of Vehicles (Gas, Diesel, Auto, RV, ATV, GE & More). I Have Seen Some Diagnostics & Reapir Quotes Well Over-Priced. What We Do As Mechanics, Is Gold. I Am Wanting To Help My Community, Family & Friends by Returning Some Of My Knowledge And Experience. I Am Not A Certified ASE Tech! I Am A Very Experienced DIY Mechanic.
